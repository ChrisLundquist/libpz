This replaces it with LSB-first 8-bit\nradix sort \\(8 passes per step\\) and moves rank assignment from sequential\nCPU readback to parallel GPU prefix sum \\(Blelloch scan + scatter\\).\n\nKey changes:\n- New kernels: bwt_radix.cl \\(compute_keys, histogram, scatter\\) and\n  bwt_rank.cl \\(compare, prefix_sum, propagate, rank_scatter\\)\n- Fix critical bug: enqueue_read_buffer offset is in bytes, not elements\n- Remove dead bitonic sort code \\(kernel compilation + method\\)\n- GPU BWT tests use round-trip verification \\(GPU circular prefix-doubling\n  produces valid but not byte-identical output vs CPU SA-IS for periodic inputs\\)\n- Add FSE benchmark to stages.rs, expand all benchmarks with large sizes\n  and timeout caps\n\nGPU BWT throughput improved ~1.8x at 64KB \\(56ms → 31ms\\) but remains\nslower than CPU — future work needs fused kernels or a different algorithm.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n\\)\")",
