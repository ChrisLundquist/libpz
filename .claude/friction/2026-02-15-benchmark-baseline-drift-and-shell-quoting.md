- Criterion baseline drift caused misleading "change" percentages across successive experiments; direct A/B stash-pop checks were required to avoid false positives.
- CLI command composition with markdown-style backticks in shell arguments caused accidental command substitution when creating PR text.
- Recovery/workaround used: explicit direct A/B benchmarking (`stash -> bench -> pop -> bench`) and plain-text PR body strings without backticks.
